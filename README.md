SMIQP is a software package for solving quadratic optimisation problems with mixed-integer variables. This project is a C code for SDP that uses CSDP, the Conic Bundle Library, and Ipopt subroutines. It can also use Cplex or Scip as sub-solvers. The solver is the implementation of algorithm MIQCR of Billionnet, Elloumi and Lambert.
