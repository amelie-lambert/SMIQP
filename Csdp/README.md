CSDP is a software package for solving semidefinite programming
problems.  This project is a C code for SDP that uses BLAS and LAPACK
subroutines.  The algorithm is a predictor-corrector version of the
primal-dual barrier method of Helmberg, Rendl, Vanderbei, and
Wolkowicz.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/coin-or/Csdp/wiki) for more

installation instructions, and documentation.
